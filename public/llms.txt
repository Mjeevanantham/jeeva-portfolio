# AI & LLM EXPERIENCE OVERVIEW

I design and integrate AI-powered systems with a focus on **practical product usage**, not academic research.

Primary focus areas:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- AI Agent Architecture
- Context Management & Prompt Engineering
- Knowledge Base Ingestion (Web & Documents)
- API-first AI system integration

---

# LLM & AI TECH STACK

## Models & Providers
- OpenAI (GPT-based models)
- Anthropic (Claude – evaluation & reasoning tests)
- Open-source LLMs (local evaluation and experimentation)

## AI Architecture Patterns
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector-based semantic search
- Chunking & embedding pipelines
- Context window optimization
- Stateless vs session-based AI agents

---

# DATA INGESTION & KNOWLEDGE PIPELINES

Implemented and experimented with:
- Website scraping for structured & unstructured data
- PDF / document ingestion
- HTML content cleaning and normalization
- Metadata enrichment for improved retrieval
- Re-indexing & incremental updates

---

# AI AGENT CAPABILITIES

Designed AI agents capable of:
- Answering domain-specific questions
- Handling multi-turn conversations
- Tool-based function calling
- Context-aware response generation
- Guardrails for hallucination reduction

---

# USE CASES

- AI-powered ERP assistance
- Client-specific website chatbots
- Knowledge-base-driven support agents
- Product onboarding and FAQ automation
